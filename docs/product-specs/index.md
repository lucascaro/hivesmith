# Product specs

The *what* and *why* of work this project plans to do. Each spec describes user value, success criteria, and explicit non-goals. The *how* lives in `docs/exec-plans/`.

## Active

## Conventions

- Stage is owned by the exec plan, not the spec — when stage changes, update this index from the plan.
- A spec is created in TRIAGE and lives forever (it is the historical record of *why we built it*). The exec plan moves to `exec-plans/completed/` on merge; the spec stays put.
- `feature-next` reads from this file's Active table, ordered by priority.
