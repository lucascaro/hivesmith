#   scripts/check-changeset.sh [BASE HEAD]
#
# Passes when the diff BASE...HEAD either adds a `.changesets/*.md` entry or
# touches only paths that never need one (EXEMPT below). With no arguments it
# compares HEAD against its merge-base with main — the local pre-push case.
# `.github/workflows/changesets.yml` calls it with the PR's base and head, so
# the hook and CI cannot disagree about what counts as exempt.
#
# Install the hook once per clone; the shared hooks dir covers every worktree:
#
#   cp scripts/hooks/pre-push "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/hooks/pre-push"
#
# A change outside EXEMPT with no user-visible effect (an internal refactor)
# still needs the `no-changeset` label in CI; CI checks the label before
# running this script.

# in step with any change. (CHANGELOG.md matches the root-markdown rule, but a PR that
# edits it fails the `block-generated-edits` job anyway.)
