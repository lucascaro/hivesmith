# check-changeset.sh — the changeset gate, shared by the pre-push hook and CI.
#
#   scripts/check-changeset.sh [BASE HEAD]
#
# Passes when the diff BASE...HEAD either adds a `.changesets/*.md` entry or
# touches only paths that never need one (EXEMPT below). With no arguments it
# compares HEAD against its merge-base with the default branch — the local
# pre-push case. Exit 1 means a changeset is missing; any other non-zero exit is
# the gate itself failing (bad arguments, unknown revision).
# `.github/workflows/changesets.yml` calls it with the PR's base and head, so
# the hook and CI cannot disagree about what counts as exempt.
#
# Install the hook once per clone. `--git-path hooks` honours core.hooksPath
# (Husky, lefthook); don't overwrite a pre-push hook that is already there —
# call this script from it instead:
#
#   hooks="$(git rev-parse --git-path hooks)"
#   [ -e "$hooks/pre-push" ] || cp scripts/hooks/pre-push "$hooks/pre-push"
#
# A change outside EXEMPT with no user-visible effect (an internal refactor)
# still needs the `no-changeset` label in CI; CI checks the label before
# running this script.

# in step with any change. (CHANGELOG.md matches the root-markdown rule, but a PR that
